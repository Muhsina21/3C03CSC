        <h2>What Is A Computer Programming?</h2>
        <p>
            Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer programme to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis,generating algorithim,profiling algorithms accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen language(commomly referred to as coding). The source of program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programs,rather than machine learning which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The process of programming is to find a sequence of instrunction that will automate the perfomance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer , often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus often requires expertise inseveral different subjects including knowledge of the application domain,specialised algorithms,and formal logic.

        <h2>Programming Language</h2>
        <p>
            Programming Languages are used to control the perfomance of the computer or machine. Nowadays, there are numerous programming languages that are becoming more general and all-purpose, but these languages have their specialities , and each language has its own advantages and disadvantages. Usually, programming languages can be classified into few types, however, these languages support multiple programming style. Every year there are a number of programming languages are implemented, but few languages are becoming very popular which may used by a professional programmer in their career.
