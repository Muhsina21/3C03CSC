          <p style="width:80%;margin:auto">Java is the programming language most commonly associated with the development of client-server applications, which are used by large businesses around the world. Java is designed to be a loosely coupled programming language, meaning that an application written in Java can run on any platform that supports Java. As a result, Java is described as the “write once, run anywhere” programming language.Java is not ideal for applications that run on the cloud, as opposed to the server (which is common for business applications). In addition, the software company Oracle, which owns Java, charges a licensing fee to use the Java Development Kit. Along with business applications, Java is used extensively in the Android mobile operating system.It may come as a surprise to you that Java and JavaScript are nothing alike. Java is widely used for Android applications, which is why it’s been a long-standing contender for the most popular programming language amongst tech experts. The “write once, run anywhere” motto refers to Java’s versatility and cross-platform abilities, and is used by more than 9 million developers around the world.Due to it being owned by Oracle, Java is made for applications that run on the server as opposed to the cloud, is highly scalable, and very well suited to enterprise applications. But don’t let that put you off - it’s one of the most sought-after programming languages out there, being used on more than 7 billion devices, and even holds up websites such as Amazon and Netflix.</p>
