            <p style="width:80%;margin:auto"> Python is widely regarded as a programming language that’s easy to learn, due to its simple syntax, a large library of standards and toolkits, and integration where other popular programming languages such as C and C++. In fact, it’s the first language that students learn in the Align program, Gorton says. “You can cover a lot of computer science concepts quickly, and it’s relatively easy to build on.” It is a popular programming language, especially among startups, and therefore Python skills are in high demand. Python is not suitable for mobile application development. Python is used in a wide variety of applications, including artificial intelligence, financial services, and data science. Social media sites such as Instagram and Pinterest are also built on Python.
    Python has always been, and continues to be, a favourite programming language amongst tech experts. It’s known for its versatility, and is perhaps the most user-friendly programming language available. Coders identify Python’s syntax as clear and intuitive - similar to that of JavaScript - making it another popular choice for those starting out in coding.You can create pretty much anything using Python, including simple scripts, applications and even neural networks for AI. Plus, it also has numerous applications for you to choose from. So if, for example, you’re interested in back-end development, then the open-source Django framework (which is written in Python) is simple and straightforward to learn. And, it’s been used to develop some of the biggest apps and sites in the world, including Spotify and Instagram.Python will always be a good choice when it comes to coding, but take note: Python 2 was discontinued in 2020, so make sure you choose Python 3.</p>
