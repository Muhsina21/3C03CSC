             <p style="width:80%;margin:auto">Microsoft developed C# as a faster and more secure variant of C. It is fully integrated with Microsoft’s .NET software framework, which supports the development of applications for Windows, browser plug-ins, and mobile devices. C# offers shared codebases, a large code library, and a variety of data types. C# can have a steep learning curve, especially for resolving errors. It is less flexible than languages such as C++. C# is the go-to language for Microsoft ad Windows application development. It can also be used for mobile devices and video game consoles using an extension of the .NET Framework called Mono.(insert well-known hashtag pun here) is built specifically for Microsoft .NET, and is a combination of the best features of C and C++. It’s one of the best, if not the best option, for developing code for Windows systems. It has a minimal runtime, making it great for developing lean applications, and its versatility means it can handle both front-end and back-end development. Although it’s the most technically complicated of the C languages, this doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the most difficult to learn. A lot of coders praise C# for being the best language to program bespoke software, which is why a lot of in-house IT teams are hiring C# specialists.If that doesn’t sound interesting enough for you, don’t forget that C# is what’s used in VR development, and is the recommended language for all 3D and 2D video game developers. </p>
