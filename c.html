        <p style="width:80%;margin:auto"> Along with Python and Java, C forms a “good foundation” for learning how to program, Gorton says. As one of the first programming languages ever developed, C has served as the foundation for writing more modern languages such as Python, Ruby, and PHP. It is also an easy language to debug, test, and maintain. Since it’s an older programming language, C is not suitable for more modern use cases such as websites or mobile applications. C also has a complex syntax as compared to more modern languages.Because it can run on any type of device,C is often used to program hardware, such as embedded devices in automobiles and medical devices used in health care.  </p>
