          <p style="width:80%;margin:auto">R is heavily used in statistical analytics and machine learning applications. The language is extensible and runs on many operating systems. Many large companies have adopted R in order to analyze their massive data sets, so programmers who know R are in great demand. R does not have the strict programming guidelines of older and more established languages. R is primarily used in statistical software products.</p>
