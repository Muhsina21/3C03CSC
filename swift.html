          <p style="width:80%;margin:auto">Swift is Apple’s language for developing applications for Mac computers and Apple’s mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Like many modern programming languages, Swift has a highly readable syntax, runs code quickly, and can be used for both client-side and server-side development. Swift can only be used on newer versions of iOS 7 and will not work with older applications. As a newer programming language, the code can be unstable at times, and there are fewer third-party resources available to programmers.Swift is used for iOS and macOS applications.Some web developers decide which code to learn based on what they’ll be able to do with it, as opposed to how long it’ll take them or how easy it is. The good news is, Swift is one of the easiest to learn, and if you’re interested in Apple products and mobile app development, it’s the perfect option for you. Swift was first announced by Apple in 2014, meaning it’s one of the newest programming languages out there, and is used to develop iOS and macOS applications. This means that not only does it run on all iPhones and iPads, but it’s also the basis for other operating systems, including watchOS and tvOS.When it comes to learning the language that powers one of the tech industry leaders, you can’t go wrong with adding Swift to your list of contenders.
