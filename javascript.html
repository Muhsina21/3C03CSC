           <p style="width:80%;margin:auto">JavaScript is the most popular programming language for building interactive websites; “virtually everyone is using it,” Gorton says. When combined with Node.js, programmers can use JavaScript to produce web content on the server before a page is sent to the browser, which can be used to build games and communication applications that run directly in the browser. A wide variety of add-ons extend the functionality of JavaScript as well. Internet browsers can disable JavaScript code from running, as JavaScript is used to code pop-up ads that in some cases can contain malicious content. JavaScript is used extensively in website and mobile application development. Node.js allows for the development of browser-based applications, which do not require users to download an application.As one of the original programming languages and most popular codes to learn, JavaScript continues to be in demand in 2020. The reason for its popularity is mainly due to it being used for both front-end and back-end programming, but also because it works so well with other languages, and it’s updated every single year.
Some of the world’s most popular sites, including YouTube, Facebook, Gmail and Twitter, all rely on JavaScript for their interactive pages. Why? Because JavaScript is a core technology and powers things such as online video and dynamic pages. Plus, if you’re looking to learn code for the first time, JavaScript works across all major browsers and is known for having a forgiving, flexible syntax. This is why it’s one of the favourites amongst beginners.In a nutshell, we can’t see the world wide web without JavaScript anytime soon.
